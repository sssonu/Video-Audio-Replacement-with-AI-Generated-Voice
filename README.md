### Video-Audio-Replacement-with-AI-Generated-Voice

#### AI-Powered Video Audio Replacement Tool
This project demonstrates an end-to-end solution for replacing the audio in video files with AI-generated voiceovers. It involves automatic transcription, grammar correction, and synthetic voice generation, all seamlessly integrated to provide an AI-based audio replacement.

##### Key Features:
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) using Whisper to transcribe the audio.
Grammar Correction using language_tool_python to enhance transcription quality.
AI Voice Generation using Coqui TTS to synthesize a natural-sounding voice based on corrected transcriptions.
Video Processing using moviepy to replace the original audio with the AI-generated voice in the final video.
Supports common video formats such as MP4, AVI, and MOV.
##### Technologies Used:
Streamlit for web interface.
MoviePy for video and audio editing.
Transformers (Whisper) for speech-to-text.
LanguageTool for grammar correction.
Coqui TTS for text-to-speech.

###### Feel free to explore the code, clone the repository, and contribute to enhancing this PoC (Proof of Concept) with additional features like multi-language support, advanced speech alignment, or real-time processing capabilities!
