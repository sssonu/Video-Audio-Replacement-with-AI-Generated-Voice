#### AI-Powered Video Audio Replacement Tool
This project demonstrates an end-to-end solution for replacing the audio in video files with AI-generated voiceovers. It involves automatic transcription, grammar correction, and synthetic voice generation, all seamlessly integrated to provide an AI-based audio replacement.

##### Key Features:
1. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) using Whisper to transcribe the audio.
2. Grammar Correction using language_tool_python to enhance transcription quality.
3. AI Voice Generation using Coqui TTS to synthesize a natural-sounding voice based on corrected transcriptions.
4. Video Processing using moviepy to replace the original audio with the AI-generated voice in the final video.
5. Supports common video formats such as MP4, AVI,MOV and MPEG4.
##### Technologies Used:
1. Streamlit for web interface.
2. MoviePy for video and audio editing.
3. Transformers (Whisper) for speech-to-text.
4. Python-Language-Tool for grammar correction.
5. Coqui TTS for text-to-speech.
